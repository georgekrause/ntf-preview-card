## My process

I think it's important to use the proper html tags to get the structor right. Next style the document with css to get the look correct.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use the proper html tags for certain elements. Using the correct tags makes styling a lot easier.

```html
<table> 
  <img src="images/icon-ethereum.svg">
  <tr>0.041 ETH</tr>
  <img src="images/icon-clock.svg">
  <tr class="time">3 days left</tr>
 </table>
```
```css
.article {
    background-color: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    width: 275px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding-left: 25px;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
